# One million \<divs> for one digital display

(or how to waste time and resources using PHP and a web browser) 😁

## Installation

Install PHP on your local machine and be sure it works. [Go here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) for further explanation, if needed. On Windows, you can [install Laragon](https://laragon.org/docs/install.html), much more user-friendly.

Clone this repo where you want, let's say in a directory named 'my-php-test'.

## Usage

Open a terminal and go in that directory : `cd my-php-test`
You can use Windows PowerShell, Git bash or Windows command prompt.
Feel free to use the Google search bar if you are uncomfortable with these tools.

Once your terminal is located in `my-php-test`, launch a local PHP server which will serve the application in your localhost. In order to do this, type `php -S localhost:8000`.

You can use the app by opening your web browser and going to http://localhost:8000

Enter a number between 0 and 99.
If you enter letters, the program will assume you entered 0.
If the entered number is lower than 0, it will take 0.
If it is greater than 99, the program will use 99.

Click 'OK'

After a certain while 😴 (hey, there are a million \<divs> to generate 😬), hopefully you'll see a nice, kinda digital, display of your number 🤯

You can click on the 'RETOUR' button in order to live through this terrific experience again 🤪

Enjoy 😅
